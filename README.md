## I help developers focus

I build web applications and productivity contraptions.<br/>
I also help software engineers be more productive at [ipdx.co](https://www.ipdx.co/).

### Who I am

For the past 7 years, I was that engineer who cared for CI because... someone had to.

And I did NOT enjoy it: 

- Tweaking YAMLs ðŸ˜’
- Reading docs about actions ðŸ˜©
- Running and re-running jobs for hours... ðŸ¥±

I decided to learn how to work efficiently with CI, joined a Productivity team, and
spent a few years specializing.

Now, I'm co-founding THE company I wish I had around when I was that Full-Stack Engineer just trying to get things done:
